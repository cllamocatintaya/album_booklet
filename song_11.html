        It's so much better
        When everyone is in, are you in?
        It's so much better
        When everyone is in, are you in?
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Ooh, hoo
        Ooh, hoo, are you in?
        Ooh, hoo
        Ooh, hoo, are you in?
    </pre>

    <pre>
        It's so much better
        When everyone is in, are you in?
        It's so much easier
        When sea foam green is in fashion
