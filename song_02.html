            <pre>
                You saw me lost and treading water
                I looked pathetic, I looked as helpless as a stinger without a bee
                But underneath my presentation, yeah
                I knew the walls were coming down and the stones that fell were aiming
                away from me, uh.
            </pre>

                Hey! What would it mean to you? (What would it mean to you?)
                To know that it'll come back around again?
                Hey! Whatever it means to you (Whatever it means to you)
                Know that everything moves in circles, yeah!
            </pre>

            <pre>
                I saw you standing i my headlights (Blink, blink, blink)
                I thought I'd run you down for the weight you left on me
                Instead I pushed rewind, reversed and drove away
                And seeing you disappear in my rearview brought to me the word
                "Reciprocity".
            </pre>

                Hey! What would it mean to you? (What would it mean to you?)
                To know that it'll come back around again?
                Hey! Whatever it means to you (Whatever it means to you)
                Know that everything moves in circles, yeah!
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Round and around we go
                Who could've known it'd end so well?
                We fall on and we fall off
                Existencial carousel...
                Spin!
