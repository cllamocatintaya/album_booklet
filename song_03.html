    <h1>Wish You Were Here</h1>

    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        I dig my toes into the sand
        The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
        I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless
        And in this moment I am happy, happy...
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I lay my head onto the sand
        The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it
        I'm counting UFO's, I signal them with my lighter
        And in this moment I am happy, happy...
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Oh yeah, woah-oh
        The world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in
        Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air saying
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I wish you were here
        I wish you were
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
        I wish you were here!
    </pre>
