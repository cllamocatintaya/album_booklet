    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        You could see me reaching
        So why couldn't you have met me in halfway?
        You could see me bleeding
        And you could not put pressure on the wound
    </pre>

    <pre>
        You only think about yourself
        You only think about yourself
        You better bend before I go
        On the first train to Mexico
    </pre>

    <pre>
        You could see me breathing
        But you still kept your hand over my mouth 
        You could feel me seething
        But you just turned your nose up in the air, oh
    </pre>

    <pre>
        You only think about yourself
        You only think about yourself
        You better bend before I go
        On the first train to Mexico
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Hoo-ha
        Hoo-ha
        Ooh-ha
        Hey-hey
    </pre>

    <pre>
        You only think about yourself
        You only think about yourself
        You better bend before I go
        On the first train to Mexico
    </pre>
