            <pre>
                Bat your eyes girl, be otherworldly,
                Count your blessings, seduce a stranger
                What's so wrong with being happy?
                Kudos to those who see through sickness, yeah
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Over and over and over and over and...
                Ooo-ooo
            </pre>

            <pre>
                When she woke in the morning
                She knew that her life had passed her by
                And she called out a warning,
                "Don't ever let life pass you by"
            </pre>

            <pre>
                I suggest we learn to love ourselves
                Before it's made illegal
                When will we learn? When will we change?
                Just in time to see it all fall down
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Those left standing... will make millions...
                Writing books on the way it should have been 
            </pre>

            <pre>
                When she woke in the morning
                She knew that her life had passed her by
                And she called out a warning,
                "Don't ever let life pass you by"
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi
                We are like frogs oblivious
                To the water starting to boil
                No one flinches, we all float face down
            </pre>

            <pre>
                When she woke in the morning
                She knew that her life had passed her by
                And she called out a warning,
                "Don't ever let life pass you by"
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Pass you by
                Oh, oh, oh
            </pre>
