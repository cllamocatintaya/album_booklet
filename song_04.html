    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        I am bottled fizzy water
        And you are shaking me up
        You are fingernail running down
        The chalkboard I thought I left in third grade
        Now my only consolation
        Is that this could not last forever
        Even though you're singing and thinking
        How well you've got it made
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Who are you?
        When will you be through?
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Yeah, it's just a phase...
        It will be over soon...
        Yeah, it's just a phase...
        Yeah, it's just a-

    <pre>
        Call it women's intuition
        But I think I'm on to something here
        Temporaryism has been the Black Plague
        And the Jesus of our age
        I know that I sound opinionated
        Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
        But sooner than later they'll be throwing
        Quarters at you on stage
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Who are you?
        When will you be through?
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Yeah, it's just a phase...
        It will be over soon...
        Yeah, it's just a phase...
        Yeah, it's just a-
        Phase! And I'm waiting for it to be over, too!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Yeah, oh ho...
        Yeah, oh ho...
        Yeah, oh ho...
        Yeah, oh ho...
        Yeah, oh ho...
        Yeah, oh ho...
