    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        There's something about the look in your eyes
        Something I noticed when the light was just right
        It reminded me twice that I was alive
        And it reminded me that you're so worth the fight
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Ooh yeah
        My biggest fear will be the rescue of me
        Strange how it turns out that way, yeah
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Could you show me dear?
        Something I've not seen 
        Something infinitely interesting
        Could you show me dear?
        Something I've not seen
        Something infinitely interesting
    </pre>

    <pre>
        There's something about the way you move
        I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing
        More subtle than something someone contrives
        Your movements echo that I've seen the real thing
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Ooh yeah
        Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you
        Strange how it turns out that way, yeah
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Could you show me dear?
        Something I've not seen 
        Something infinitely interesting
        Could you show me dear?
        Something I've not seen
        Something infinitely interesting
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Hoo
        Ooh yeah
        Hoo-ha
