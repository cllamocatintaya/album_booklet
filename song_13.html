    <pre>
        I'm floating down a river
        Oars freed from their holes long ago
        Lying face up on the floor of my vessel
        I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Two weeks without my lover
        I'm in this boat alone
        Floating down a river named emotion
        Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I'm building an antenna
        Transmissions will be sent when I am through
        Maybe we could meet again further down the river
        And share what we both discovered then revel in the view
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
        Further down the river
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
        I'm floating down a river
    </pre>
