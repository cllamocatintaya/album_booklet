            <pre>
                7am...
                The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
                And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
                Could I push rewind?
                Oh, the credits traverse signifying the end
                But I missed the best part, could we please go back to start?
            </pre>

            <pre>Forgive my indecision...</pre>

            <pre>
                Then again, then again
                Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
                But then again, then again
                Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, babe...
            </pre>

            <pre>
                11am
                By now you would think that I would be up
                But my bed sheets shade the heat of choices I've made
                And what did I find?
                I never thought I could want someone so much
                'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Forgive my indecision...
                I am only a man...
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Then again, then again
                Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
                But then again, then again
                Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, babe...
            </pre>

            <pre>
                12pm and my dusty telephone rings
                Heavy head up from my pillow, who could it be?
                I hope it's you...
                It's you...
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Then again, then again
                Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
                But then again, then again
                Then again, the day has come and I want off that ride, babe
            </pre>
