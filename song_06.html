    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        I don't want to talk to you anymore!
        I'm afraid of what I might say
        I bite my tongue everytime you come around
        'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Hand over my heart, I swear I've tried
        Everything I could within all my power
        Two weeks and one hour I slaved
        And now I've got nothing to show
        Oh, if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall
        From now on I'm going to start holding my breath
        When you come around and you flex that fake grin
        'Cause something inside me has said more than twice
        That breathing less air beats brething you in
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I don't want to talk to you anymore!
        I'm afraid of what I might say
        I bite my tongue everytime you come around
        'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Hand over my mouth, I'm earning the right to my silence
        In quiet, discerning between ego and timing
        Good judgment is once again proving to me
        That it's still worth its weight in gold
        From now on I'm gonna be so much more wary
        When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
        Seeing you is like pulling teeth
        And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil, oh yeah
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I don't want to talk to you anymore!
        I'm afraid of what I might say
        I bite my tongue everytime you come around
        'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground!
    </pre>

    <pre>
        High fives to better judgment
        By saying less today, I will gain more, gain more
        Low twos to you, my, my fickle friend
        You've brought the art of silent war
    </pre>

    <pre>
        I don't want to talk to you anymore!
        I'm afraid of what I might say
        I bite my tongue everytime you come around
        'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground!
