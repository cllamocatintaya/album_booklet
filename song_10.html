    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        To get up and walk away would be too easy
        So stay and stand your ground, just watch your mouth with me
        On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming
        So here you and I should tread as soft as these razor blades 
        For boots will let be
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
        Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
        And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
        They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Thought unabashed honesty would be ideal
        But a prophet did once say that honesty is a lonely word
        So where do we go from here, abandon ship now?
        My problem is you made me melt and I don't want to be frozen anymore
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
        Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
        And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
        They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Have you ever, have you ever tried to?
        I have never, I have never tried to
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
        Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
        And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
        They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed
    </pre>
