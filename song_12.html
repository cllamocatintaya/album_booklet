    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>

    <pre>
        When I close my eyes
        I can see for miles
        There's comfort in my dark seat
        And chaos it the aisles
    </pre>

    <pre>
        These eyes are not your eyes
        And these eyes are not the color
        That your arid eyes might be
        No, I was not around
        When those eyes of yours decided so
        I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see
    </pre>

    <pre>
        When I close my eyes
        I remmeber why I smile
        Under my umbrella 
        I'm an accomplished exile
    </pre>

    <pre>
        These eyes are not your eyes
        And these eyes are not the color
        That your arid eyes might be
        No, I was not around
        When those eyes of yours decided so
        I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see
    </pre>

    <pre>
        If this is right, I'd rather be wrong
        If this is sight, I'd rather be blind
    </pre>

    <pre>
        These eyes are not your eyes
        And these eyes are not the color
        That your arid eyes might be
        No, I was not around
        When those eyes of yours decided so
        I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see
    </pre>

    <pre>
        If this is right, I'd rather be wrong
        If this is sight, I'd rather be blind
    </pre>
