            <pre>
                Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons
                Betten that witnessing newborn nebulas in bloom
                She who sees from up high smiles and surely singles
                Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings.
            </pre>

                I haven't felt the way I feel today 
                In so long it's hard for me to specify
                I'm beginning to notice
                How much this feels like a waking limb
                Pins and needles, nice to know you!
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you!
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go
                And higher than the heights of what we often think we know
                Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
                To obtain a bird's eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze.
            </pre>

            <pre>
                I haven't felt the way I feel today 
                In so long it's hard for me to specify
                I'm beginning to notice
                How much this feels like a waking limb
                Pins and needles, nice to know you!
            </pre>

            <pre>
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you!
            </pre>

                Could it be that it has been there all along?
            </pre>

            <pre>
                I haven't felt the way I feel today 
                In so long it's hard for me to specify

                How much this feels like a waking limb

                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you!
                Goodbye, nice to know you, to know you!
